# Lecture 1 - Questions/Answers - Introduction

What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron?
> The Mark 1 Perceptron

Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)?
> 1. A set of processing units
> 2. A state of activation
> 3. An output function for each unit
> 4. A pattern of connectivity among units
> 5. A propagation rule for propagating patterns of activities through the network of connectivities
> 6. An activation rule for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce an output for the unit
> 7. A learning rule whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience
> 8. An environment within which the system must operate

What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?
> The perceived inability of neural networks to solve certain problems (due to the focus on single-layer perceptrons). The overemphasis on two-layer networks despite the practical advantages of deeper architectures.

Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognise images in a photo?
> Traditional programs lack the flexibility, adaptability, and learning capabilities needed to handle the complexity and variability of image data. This is where machine learning, particularly deep learning with neural networks, excels.  Instead of relying on rigid rules, these models learn from data, allowing them to recognize patterns and features in a more robust and generalizable way

What did Samuel mean by "weight assignment"?
> "Weight assignment" refers to setting the values of variables ("weights") that control how a program operates, like tuning the knobs of a machine to change its behavior.

What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called "weights"?
>Parameters

Draw a picture that summarises Samuel's view of a machine learning model.

> Inputs ---> 
| Model | ---> Results
Weights --> 

Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?
> Because it is difficult (but not impossible) to audit its decision making process, its attribution of weights, after the model has been trained

What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?
> The Universal Approximation Theorem shows that a neural network can approximate any continuous function, highlighting their flexibility.
